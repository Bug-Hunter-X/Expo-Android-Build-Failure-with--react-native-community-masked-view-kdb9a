This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `@react-native-community/masked-view` package.  The build process fails with a cryptic error message, often related to missing resources or unresolved dependencies, even though the package appears correctly installed.  The exact error message may vary but usually points towards issues within the Android build system.  For instance, errors might relate to missing files in the `android/app/build` directory or during the linking phase of the build process.
